## About


This project took about 40 hours to complete!
The goals were: 
1. Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
2. Create a clear and accessible user interface
3. Make network requests to retrieve data
4. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
5. Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

### Technologies
Javascript, HTML, CSS, Webpack, Mocha & Chai, Fetch API, Le Mac. 
challenges, wins, and any other reflections

### Victories and Struggles
- The biggest challenges were the Fetch requests, and seeing how they work. I struggled with calling API's more than once, but was able to use the POST request to still accomplish the goals, this was the biggest challenge and required the most time. The biggest Victory was being able to use media queries and keyframes! I havn't had much to any experience with them before and it was great to start!

```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```
Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.

---

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should the website in all its glory! Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
